# ticketerr
CIS 499 project

We use PHP, HTML, and CSS to create an application for our ITS Department. It includes a log-in system for ITS employees, an external form for Lander students to request work tickets to ITS, and an internal site where those tickets and others created by ITS staff are located, manipulated, and stored.

XAMPP connects our phpMyAdmin database and our VS Code files. You would need both on your local build to fully use this application. The files are here to display the functionality.
